# judoNative SDK for Swift

This is the new judoNative Swift SDK. It contains base work to easily access the REST API with all the validation and helper methods needed to make simple payments with a fully custom UI. If you are interested in a simple integration of payments without having to implement a full custom UI, fraud prevention, 3DS, AVS, etc as well as PCI compliance yourself, have a look at the [judoKit](https://github.com/JudoPay/JudoKit) project which contains this as a base module.

If you still would like to implement everything yourself, we strongly recommend you to use the [judoSecure](https://github.com/JudoPay/Judo-Security) Framework and send device related information along with transaction requests to ensure safety and fraud security for all your payments.


### What is this project for?

The judoNative Swift SDK is a framework for accessing the [judoPay](https://www.judopay.com/) backend API for making and accepting payments inside your app as easy and frictionless as possible.

## Integration

### Sign up judo's platform

- To use judo SDKs, you'll need to [sign up](https://www.judopay.com/signup) and get your app token. 
- the SDK has to be integrated into your project using one of the following methods:

#### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.39 supports Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

add judo to your `Podfile` to integrate it into your Xcode project:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Judo', '~> 1.5'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```


#### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) - decentralized dependency management.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

- To integrate judo into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "JudoPay/Judo-Swift" >= 1.5
```

- On your application targets’ “General” settings tab, in the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section, drag and drop each framework you want to use from the Carthage/Build folder on disk.
- On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script with the following contents:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

And add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Judo.framework
```

### Manual integration

You can integrate judo into your project manually if you prefer not to use dependency management.

#### Adding the framework

- Add judo as a [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by opening the Terminal, changing into your project directory, and entering the following command:

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/JudoPay/Judo-Swift
```

- Open the new `Judo` folder, and drag the `Judo.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.
- Select the `Judo.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section.
- Select `Judo.framework` nested inside the `Workspace` folder on the top.


### Further setup

- Add `import Judo` to the top of the file where you want to use the SDK.

- To instruct the SDK to communicate with the sandbox, include the following line  `Judo.sandboxed = true`. When you are ready to go live you can remove this line. We would recommend to put this in the method `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in your AppDelegate.

- You can also set your key and secret here if you do not wish to include it in all subsequent calls `Judo.setToken(token:, secret:)`.


### Examples

#### Token and Secret
The token and secret are accessible from your judo account [here](https://portal.judopay.com/Developer). After you have created an app you can either generated sandbox or live tokens. We recommend you to set this in your AppDelegate in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

```swift
let token = "a3xQdxP6iHdWg1zy"
let secret = "2094c2f5484ba42557917aad2b2c2d294a35dddadb93de3c35d6910e6c461bfb"

// Judo.didSetTokenAndSecret() returns false

Judo.setToken(token, secret: secret)

// Judo.didSetTokenAndSecret() returns true
```

#### Make a simple payment

The judoNative Swift SDK takes a reactive approach.

##### Card payment

```swift
let judoID = "100111222"
let references = Reference(yourConsumerReference: "consumer0053252")
let address = Address(line1: "242 Acklam Road", line2: "Westbourne Park", line3: nil, town: "London", postCode: "W10 5JJ")
let card = Card(number: "4976000000003436", expiryDate: "12/15", cv2: "452", address: address)
let amount = Amount(amountString: "30", currency: .GBP)
let emailAddress = "hans@email.com"
let mobileNumber = "07100000000"

let judoShield = JudoShield()

self.judoShield.locationWithCompletion { (coordinate, error) -> Void in
    if let error = error {
        self.delegate?.payViewController(self, didEncounterError: error)
    } else {
    	self.currentLocation = coordinate
    }
}

let deviceSignal = judoShield.deviceSignal()

do {
	let makePayment = try Judo.payment(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
								.card(card)
								.location(location)
								.deviceSignal(deviceSignal)
								.contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
								.completion({ (data, error) -> () in
									if let _ = error {
										// failure
									} else {
										// success
									}
								})
} catch {
	// error creating a Transaction e.g. the judoID could be in a wrong format
}
```

##### Token payment
```swift
Judo.payment(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
	.paymentToken(payToken)
	.location(location)
	.deviceSignal(deviceSignal)
	.contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
	.completion({ (data, error) -> () in
		if let _ = error {
			// failure
		} else {
			// success
		}
	})
```

Notice that the only difference is calling `.paymentToken(payToken)` with a valid `PaymentToken` instead of `.card(card)` for making a token payment instead of a card payment. This process is the same for pre-authorizations and token pre-authorizations.

##### Card pre-authorization

```
Judo.preAuth(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
	.card(card)
	.location(location)
	.deviceSignal(deviceSignal)
	.contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
	.completion({ (data, error) -> () in
		if let _ = error {
			// error
		} else {
			// success
		}
	})
```

##### Token pre-authorization

```
Judo.preAuth(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
	.paymentToken(payToken)
	.location(location)
	.deviceSignal(deviceSignal)
	.contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
	.completion({ (data, error) -> () in
		if let _ = error {
			// error
		} else {
			// success
		}
	})
```
