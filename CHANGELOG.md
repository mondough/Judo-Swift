## [2.0.0](https://github.com/JudoPay/Judo-Swift/releases/tag/2.0.0)
to be Released on 2016-02-29

#### Added
- Brazilian Real static accessor in `Currency`
- AmountMissingError for an error that can occur in very rare cases when a Payment or PreAuth is created without providing an amount
- InvalidPostCodeError for an error that can occur when an invalid post code has been entered

#### Changed
- Removed static accessors in favor of creating a session var in each project
- Date fields now have an error message
- Tests now run directly using the sandboxed API
- Removed API mocks from package
- All functions and properties in `Judo` are not `static` anymore
- We moved the endpoint method from `Judo` and placed it into the `Session` class which makes more sense as an origin for this variable
- A new init() method that initializes your judo session with a given token and secret

```swift
let myJudoSession = Judo("your token", secret: "your secret")
```
- In light of creating the judo session, the method which checks if a device is jailbroken has been moved into the initializer. It throws an exception in case the code is executed on a jailbroken device. If you need to restrict usage from jailbroken devices, use the following method instead:

```swift
let myJudoSession = try Judo("your token", secret: "your secret", allowJailbrokenDevices: true)
```

You can expect that the only exception that is thrown is the `JailbrokenDeviceDisallowedError` so you could also do the following:

```swift
let myJudoSession = try? Judo("your token", secret: "your secret", allowJailbrokenDevices: true)
```

In this case, if the code was executed on a jailbroken device, the myJudoSession optional will be nil.

#### Removed
- amount entry from register card

a function has been added to `Judo`

This creates a new class `VoidTransaction` which 

- A parameter for setting initialRecurringPayment

public private (set) var initialRecurringPayment: Bool = false
```
