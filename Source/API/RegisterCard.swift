/**
When you want to register a card, you create a RegisterCard object and start adding the necessary information. This transaction only supports one kind of registration. You have to do this using a full set of card details.

- Card registration
- For registrations where you have the full card details including the card number.

[`Transaction`](Transaction) contains all the necessary implementation of Payments, PreAuths and RegisterCards since these are very closely related

### Card registration

```swift
    myJudoSession.registerCard(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
                 .card(card)
                 .location(location)
                 .contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
                 .completion({ (data, error) -> () in
                     if let _ = error {
                         // failure
                     } else {
                         // success
                     }
    })
```
