/**
When you want to process a Pre-authorization, you create a Pre-auth object and start adding the necessary information. This Transaction supports two types of Pre-auths. You can process Pre-auths using a full set of card details, or by referencing a previously processed transaction.

- Card Pre-auth
    - For pre-auths where you have the full card details including the card number.
- Token Pre-auth
    - For processing payments using a saved card (requires the Card token and Consumer token values).

[`Transaction`](Transaction) contains all the necessary implementation of Payments and Pre-auths since these are very closely related.

### Card Pre-auth

```swift
    Judo.preauth(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
        .card(card)
        .location(location)
        .contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
        .completion({ (data, error) -> () in
            if let _ = error {
                // failure
            } else {
                // success
            }
        })
```

### Token Pre-auth

```swift token payment
    Judo.payment(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
        .paymentToken(payToken)
        .location(location)
        .contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
        .completion({ (data, error) -> () in
            if let _ = error {
                // failure
            } else {
                // success
            }
        })
```
