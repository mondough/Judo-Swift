/** 
You can get a copy of the receipt for an individual transaction by creating a Receipt Object and calling `.completion(() -> ())` including the receipt id for the transaction in the path.
Alternatively you can receive a list of all the Transactions. By default it will return 10 transactions. These results are returned in time descending order by default, so it will return the latest 10 transactions.

### receipt by ID
```swift
    Judo.receipt(receiptID).completion({ (dict, error) -> () in
        if let _ = error {
            // error
        } else {
            // success
        }
    })
```

### all receipts
```swift
    Judo.receipt(nil).completion({ (dict, error) -> () in
        if let _ = error {
            // error
        } else {
            // success
        }
    })
```
