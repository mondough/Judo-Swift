/**
When you want to process a payment transaction you create a Payment object and start adding the necessary Information. This Transaction supports two types of Payments. You can process payments using a full set of card details, or by referencing a previously processed transaction.

- Card Payment
    - For payments where you have the full card details including the card number.
- Token Payment
    - For processing payments using a saved card (requires the Card token and Consumer token values).

`Transaction` contains all the necessary implementation of Payments and PreAuths since these are very closely related

### Card Payment

```swift
    Judo.payment(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
        .card(card)
        .location(location)
        .contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
        .completion({ (data, error) -> () in
            if let _ = error {
                // failure
            } else {
                // success
            }
        })
```

### Token Payment

```swift token payment
    Judo.payment(correctJudoID, amount: amount, reference: references)
        .paymentToken(payToken)
        .location(location)
        .contact(mobileNumber, emailAddress)
        .completion({ (data, error) -> () in
            if let _ = error {
                // failure
            } else {
                // success
            }
        })
```
